JavaScript BattleShip Game and AI

https://kensand.github.io/BattleshipAI/

# To Do List:
- [ ] Create loop for AI vs AI games for easy result checking  
- [x] Create counters for each player that record # of games won  
- [ ] Create counter for average game length  
- [ ] Create q-learning AI  
- [ ] Refactor code to make style consistent  
- [ ] Make it so that AI's are passed states without the list of unsunk ships - just feels like cheating otherwise(even if its only used to get the ship lengths remaining...)  
- [ ] right click to rotate ship during placement  
- [x] show all ships after game over for human vs ai game  
- [x] disable ai selection dropdown during game  
- [ ] Document, document, document, document, document...
